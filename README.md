# Hey there, I’m Aditya 👋

Aspiring software sorcerer 🧙‍♂️ currently disguised as a Computer Science student at KIIT. I spend most of my waking hours convincing machines to do what I want using **Dart**, **Kotlin**, **Python**, **Java** and dont forget the OG Chat bots, and sometimes just pure emotional manipulation.

🔍 **Tech Enthusiast Alert**  
I'm wildly curious about **emerging tech**, and if there’s a new gadget, AI breakthrough, or mind-blowing GPU launch — you bet I’m deep into a rabbit hole about it.

💻 I love building PCs almost as much as I love watching car/bike tech videos and trying to figure out how close we are to putting ChatGPT in a Tesla (but I’m just a pure gas car lover — they are godly, no debate).

🛠️ **Developer Life**  
I dabble in everything from:
- Building **habit-tracking apps** that remind you of your broken new year promises 😅
- To crafting **AI models** that are almost as confused as I am during exams.

🧑‍💻 Currently working as a **Flutter Intern at NoKasa**, where I:
- Design pixel-perfect UIs 🎨  
- Squash bugs like it’s Whack-a-Mole 🪲🔨  
- Optimize performance so things load before the heat death of the universe ⚡

🌌 When I’m not breaking production or adding unnecessary features at 2 AM, you’ll find me:
- Tinkering with open-source stuff (shoutout to **GSSoC 2024** 🙌)
- Switching between dark and darker themes 🖤
- Pretending I understand quantum computing 💫

🤖 **Certified in Responsible AI** (Google Cloud)  
Yes, my AI doesn’t just stalk people — it does so **ethically** 😇.
