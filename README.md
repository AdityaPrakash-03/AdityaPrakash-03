# Hey there, I’m Aditya 👋

Aspiring software sorcerer 🧙‍♂️ currently disguised as a Computer Science student at KIIT. I spend most of my waking hours convincing machines to do what I want using Dart, Kotlin, Python, Java, and sometimes just pure emotional manipulation.

I'm wildly curious about **emerging tech**, and if there’s a new gadget, AI breakthrough, or mind-blowing GPU launch — you bet I’m deep into a rabbit hole about it. I love building PCs almost as much as I love watching car/bike tech videos and trying to figure out how close we are to putting ChatGPT in a Tesla (but I am just a pure gas car lover, they are just godly).

I dabble in everything from building habit-tracking apps that remind you of your broken new year promises, to AI models that are almost as confused as I am during exams. Currently working as a Flutter Intern at **NoKasa**, where I design pixel-perfect UIs, squash bugs like it’s Whack-a-Mole, and optimize performance so things load before the heat death of the universe.

When I’m not breaking production or adding unnecessary features at 2 AM, you’ll find me tinkering with open-source stuff (shoutout to **GSSoC 2024**), switching between dark and darker themes, and pretending I understand quantum computing.

If you're looking for someone to build apps, solve bugs, push code, debate tabs vs spaces (tabs, obviously), or just vibe with music and caffeine while saving the world one commit at a time — I might be your guy.

**Certified in Responsible AI** by Google Cloud — so yes, my AI doesn’t just stalk people, it does so ethically.
